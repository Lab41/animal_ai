# Env folder

You can download my environment for linux from here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1v5NuoZgnAAsAhs9m7kZjJxUyymvKyWah 

Copy the executive file(.x86_64) and folder (AnimnalAi_Ali_Data) to this directory (animal_ai_private/env). 

It should be mentioned that in order to train the model with model in the example folder(animal_ai_private/Examples) the file name has to be changed to AnimalAI.x86_64 or edit the python model directory.
